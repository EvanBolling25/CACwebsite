            </h3>
            <p>
              The club started out as a facebook post in summer 2018 asking if any USC students wanted to start an Automotive club. then Jeff harris and Peter sullivan formally created the club in 2019. they then set up autocross events against clemson and other clubs,
              <br> where they lost the first event and then came back the second time to win the event with flying colors.Later on, The second president Dylan Yuknis added a weeked trip centered a fun and safe way to drive our cars in the mountaions,<br>
               which we call "mountain weekend".Under the Current president,Will Holiday, The club contiones its tradtions of mountain weekend and autocross events but have also added cahrity events and fundraisers to the clubs ideals to give back to the community.<!---text for history of the club-->
